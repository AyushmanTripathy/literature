# The Marriage

Our story starts with our first two protagonists, a1 and a2, being arranged for marriage by our third protagonist, b1.

The Marriage was a day to remember for everybody, especially for the baratis, who on reaching the unelectrified village, were denied food or a place to rest. The groom was snatched from the barat and secretly married. The angry baratis set out to return to their own village. This news reached c2 and x2, who at once started the preparation of food for the hungry baratis. The fish curry that was supposed to be served in the next day's reception party was served to the baratis. Earlier when this kind of treatment was given to the barat, c1 had proposed to leave the marriage immediately, but against his wishes, a1 married a2.

After the wedding, the newly married bride and groom returned to the latter's village and their reception was carried out. This marked the start of a duel between b1, a1 and a2, for reasons that included, buying a cheap face powder instead of expensive one (Ponds), cheaper models of soap or for not having fish in the menu.

This duel resulted in a1 and a2 barricading the last room door with the sofa (brought as dowry by a2) and thus dividing the house into two. A separate kitchen was therefore achieved by a2 in 15 days of time, a truly amazing record. Which proves that a2 was one hell of a bahu.

a2 firstly financed his now separate family by the money he received as gifts in his reception party. Later b2 got him a kirana store, fully stocked, so that he could start a business. The store was very soon transferred to Laxmipur, and the "sold" by a1. b2 then got them a auto rickshaw, which was first drived then rented and finally was sold by our protagonist. This selling was tried to be kept a secret but was eventually exposed. Now a1 started the business of logging tree from the forest around the village a2's brother in law. In this time frame, x2 was already in Bangalore.

Eventually a1 and a2 then shifted with their sadu (a2's brother in law) in Bhawnipatna. Here a3 was conceived. a3 was born on the eve of Nuakhai. At this point b1 and b2 invited the couple to return with them with their new born grandson. Losing the pleasure of separate living from sas and sasur was however not well received by a2, which led to frequent fleeing of hers to her maternal house. In between of all this, the poor kid a3, not receiving mother's milk, became sickly. Yes, a2 didn't used to take her son with her on those maternal home visits.

# The Groom Selling

Inspired by watching half of the movie Judaai, a2 decided to temporarily solve her financial problems by selling her husband. However as in the film the husband does not yeild her 2 crore but only mere a sum of 2 lakhs rupees. The buyer, a5, was a working women, who also got her father's pension. This "happy" family now lived "peacefully" in Dhenkanal.

In one of the other episodes, we have seen how a1 has gotten a police case on his name (bolero loan fraud). Well now, the Court has ordered a surrender warrant for him. That brave man sent his second wife, a5, to Bhawnipatna to resolve the issue and to meet a family lawyer. The hosts for the visitor were x1 and x2. a1 had requested x1 to quietly host a5 and then send her off to Dhenkanal.

After the mission of a5 was completed, instead of leaving for Dhenkanal, went to visit a temple with her sas, b1. b1, in spite of warning by x1, took her new daughter in law to her house. When c1 got hold of this news, he got infuriated. c2 knowing this was her opportunity to finally get a separate family, went on to act as oil on the fire. c2 assaulted b1 severely and the scared b1, b2 and a5 fled to x1's house. This incident was around the time of 2 at night.

At the stroke of morning the old couple filed a FIR against c1. He was called to the police station, where x2 was also called for making negotiations between the two parties. c1 was made to leave the house in 2 days of time and a5 finally returned to Dhenkanal. During this whole family drama, a1, did not pick the phones and went compltely silent.

# The Cold Murder

After the episode in Bhawnipatna, things were getting heated up at the Dhenkanal residency. Regular fight which being quite normal for the Mishra family and which normally meant shouting and not eating food, where turning violent. The punching bag was the a5 for a1, a2 and a4. The beating was also severe and once led to making a5 completely blind from one eye. The non psychopathic member of the family, a3, used to run on the streets during this time, asking for the bus drivers to take him to his grandparents.

The grandparents frequently used to visit Dhenkanal and every time it was a great disaster. b1 at this point of time had already sold their property in town and was spending this money on her son and grandson quite handsomely. b1 invited a2, a3 and a4 to stay with them back in Bhawnipatna. They obviously obliged. What happened following this is a very interesting story, which we will see in the next chapter.

But the beating that a5 took made her lose her appetite. She slowly rotted away and finally died on the October of 2020.

# The Decomposition

When a2 along with a3 and a4 returned to b1's house. What followed was a grand party every day for the visitors, especially fish and mutton. b1 and b2 also got a lot from them, rows of insults and medical bills. b1 financed a3's admission into Khallikote University, But a3 saw a big fat boy on the visit and being shit scared, did not join the university. He wasted a complete year doing nothing. a4 also got admission, but into Sisumandir. Transition from CBSE to CHSE was to improve his marking in the 10th board exam. A year later, a3 finally joined the Kalahandi University, but did not get the Science stream and thus joined under the Humanities stream. He proudly went to the university everyday with b2 on his luna.
